COM,OLE and ACTIVEX Relationship:
COM is the backbone of all the OLE technologies.OLE 1.0 was a 16-Bit technology that appeared around 1991.
It enabled software applications to share information through linking and embedding. Certain applications 
may export visual objects to other applications. A host application may embed this object inside itself 
(Which produced a copy of the original data) or reference through a link(which is the connection to thr 
original data source)

A classic example of this technology is an MS-Word document containing an embedded MS-Excel spreadsheet.

Active X is the current blanket name for any COM-based technology
